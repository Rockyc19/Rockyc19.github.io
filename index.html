            Hi, As a software development student at Gilde Roermond, I mainly
            work with PHP and JavaScript. PHP allows me to build dynamic web
            applications and retrieve data from databases, while JavaScript
            allows me to add interactive elements and dynamic content to my
            projects. My experience with these languages grows with every
            project I tackle, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my
            skills and learn more about the possibilities they bring to software
            development.

                In my first year, I started the Software Developer program at
                MBO level 4. Prior to this, I had no experience with coding, so
                everything was entirely new to me. The first half of the year
                was a combined class of Software Development and ICT Management,
                focusing mainly on theory, including HTML and CSS. In the second
                half, I was introduced to PHP and tasked with creating a time
                tracking system where different roles had to be assigned to the
                appropriate users. This was quite a challenging project for me
                at the time, as I had zero prior experience.

                In my second year, we were introduced to a new programming
                language: C#. Our main project was to develop a point-of-sale
                (POS) system for a restaurant. We were divided into groups,
                which required us to learn how to collaborate effectively. We
                used tools like Trello for project management and held daily
                stand-ups to stay aligned. Each team member had their own
                responsibilities, and my role was to develop the POS system
                itself. <br />
                <br />
                I had to ensure that customers could make payments, employees'
                details could be accessed, working hours were visible, inventory
                management was integrated, and notifications from tables were
                received and displayed. It was a fun and engaging project, but
                it also taught me the importance of teamwork, as everything had
                to work seamlessly together. In the end, we delivered the
                project and presented it to the restaurant, and they were
                impressed with our work.

                In the second half of my second year, we started our
                internships. I interned at IBI², an organization that integrates
                biomimicry—drawing inspiration from nature—to create sustainable
                solutions for sectors like agriculture, construction, and
                transportation. They focus on holistic approaches, such as the
                Blue Economy, which promotes eco-friendly business models and
                technologies that turn scarcity into abundance while respecting
                natural ecosystems. IBI² offers services like sustainability
                assessments (QuickScans) and runs the Futures Academy, where
                participants learn about sustainability, biomimicry, and
                building resilient business models. This was my first
                internship, and to be honest, it wasn’t the best experience. As
                second-year students, we were given assignments that were too
                advanced for our skill level. Additionally, our internship
                supervisor often hinted that our internship could be rejected if
                we expressed doubts about successfully completing the tasks.
                <br />
                <br />

                Our main task was to develop an improved version of their
                QuickScan tool, making it faster and more efficient. The tool I
                created during my internship helps companies evaluate their
                performance on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). IBI²
                uses this tool to generate reports for businesses and provide
                recommendations on how they can align with the SDG standards set
                by the EU. The tool allows users to create reports, review
                previous ones, and print outputs. Despite the challenges,
                completing this project was a valuable learning experience.

              <p class="content-timeline-description">
                In my third year, we had a significant workload compared to the
                previous years. One of the highlights was learning Python from
                one of our instructors, followed by a project where we had to
                display real-time weather, traffic, train schedules, and news
                updates on a TV screen. My specific task was to showcase the
                weather using an API. I initially started working on this in
                JavaScript, and it was a challenging project because it relied
                heavily on the data provided by the API. My goal was to display
                the weather for the entire week, with a new day being added
                daily and staying up to date. However, the first API I used
                could only show the weather for the current day, which didn’t
                meet my expectations. After some searching, I found another API
                that provided the required data, and I was able to achieve my
                goal. <br />
                <br />Unfortunately, teamwork during this project was not ideal.
                Out of the blue, the team decided to switch to React, which
                meant I had to rewrite the entire weather API functionality in
                React. This was challenging at first since React was new to me.
                However, I quickly adapted, and in the end, we managed to create
                a functional and polished app.

                The second half of the school year was focused on preparing for
                our exams. My project group consisted of friends, which had its
                pros and cons. While working on one of the projects, one team
                member was unable to deliver their part on time. As a result, I
                had to step in and complete their portion last-minute to ensure
                that we still had a functioning project to present. The
                assignment involved creating a system for reserving rooms or
                offices. In a short amount of time, I managed to develop the
                majority of the project. I implemented features such as: <br />
                <br />

                Different user roles (e.g., admin, staff). <br />
                <br />
                A secure login system with hashed passwords. <br />
                <br />
                Separate pages for admin and staff members. <br />
                <br />
                Functionality to create, edit, and delete rooms,companies,
                contacts, and employees. <br />
                <br />
                A dashboard to view active and inactive rooms, including
                detailed descriptions such as the number of tables, seating
                capacity, available TVs, and other details. <br />
                <br />
                We were a team of three, but I ended up doing more than half of
                the work. Despite the challenges, I made sure we delivered a
                complete and functional system.

                During the final part of year 3, we were given additional
                assignments and participated in a special program at Zuyd
                University of Applied Sciences. This program was designed to
                shorten the duration of studies for those who planned to
                continue their education there. As part of this program, we
                completed several assignments, such as creating a "Hangman"
                game. I added an extra feature where a player could play solo
                and receive random words from an API. Although I successfully
                completed the program and earned the option for a shortened
                curriculum at Zuyd, I ultimately decided not to pursue it.
                <br />
                <br />

                When exam season arrived, we were tasked with completing a major
                project over one week. The process was as follows: Day 1: We
                started by analyzing a provided text to extract user stories,
                acceptance criteria, and the project goal. Day 2: This day
                focused on designing sketches and creating an Entity
                Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the database. I also prepared a
                use case diagram, an activity diagram, and outlined the coding
                conventions. Our team ensured that the sketches, database
                design, and code conventions aligned well. Day 3–5: Coding began
                on the third day, and we received the finalized database and
                user stories from the instructors. There were three levels of
                difficulty (A, B, and C), and I was given the hardest version
                (confirmed by the instructor). <br />
                <br />

                Exam Project Details The project revolved around a scheduling
                and resource management system for a driving school. These were
                the user stories I worked on: Login System: Implemented a secure
                system for logging in. <br />
                <br />
                Car Management: Allowed the owner to add, edit, and delete cars
                to manage the fleet. <br />
                <br />
                Time Block Management: Enabled the owner to add time blocks for
                scheduling lessons and planning instructor availability.<br />
                <br />
                Resource Allocation: Developed functionality to assign time
                blocks to instructors and cars for lesson scheduling and
                resource management. <br />
                <br />
                Usage Monitoring: Created a feature to provide an overview of
                car usage within a specific period.<br />
                <br />
                Instructor Availability Overview: Tasked with displaying a daily
                and weekly summary of instructor availability
                (busy/available/unavailable). <br />
                <br />

                Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I couldn't complete this
                feature. Despite the tight deadline, I completed all the tasks
                except the last one. The final project was submitted and
                presented successfully. A week later, I received the news that I
                had passed the exam. This was a challenging but rewarding
                experience, and I was proud of what I achieved in such a short
                timeframe.

                This was not the end of the school year, as we still had two
                more assignments to complete. One of the assignments allowed us
                to choose from three different projects, and we decided to work
                on the audiometer. This project was developed for a client
                seeking a tool to assess individuals' hearing capabilities. The
                audiometer allows users to play beep sounds at various
                frequencies and volumes to evaluate hearing, primarily targeting
                children. The results are displayed in a detailed graph,
                enabling the client to create customized music that supports
                optimal auditory development for each individual. <br />

                We were also required to complete a final project, with the
                condition that it had to be innovative. This meant using a
                programming language that we had rarely or never used before,
                along with a database. I chose to work with JavaScript and a
                MySQL database. For my project, I decided to create a 2D
                fighting game with different characters. These characters were
                based on my friends, with their faces incorporated into the
                game. It was an enjoyable project where players could pick up
                power-ups, view a health bar, and enjoy music and sound effects.
                Additionally, the database tracked the win condition. This
                marked the end of my third school year.

              <p class="content-timeline-description">
                In the fourth year, I only worked during the first half of the
                year, after which I would be done. This year, we had to go on an
                internship. During the internship, I had to attend the Fontys
                University of Applied Sciences in Venlo every Wednesday for a
                program related to an accelerated academic year. As a result,
                sometimes I was overwhelmed with a heavy workload, but you can’t
                keep throwing sixes all the time. <br> <br>
                 
                I did my internship at
                Aandachttrekkers in Oostrum. Based in Oostrum, it is a dynamic
                full-service agency specializing in creative advertising and
                sign production. Their expertise spans three core areas: concept
                & design, digital communication, and advertising production.
                They offer services such as logo and house style design, website
                development, vehicle and building signage, digital signage, and
                print materials like banners, posters, and exhibition displays. <br> <br>

                In the first few weeks, I mainly worked with Prodiz Memoria,
                where I had to fix a few bugs and didn’t have much else to do.
                Prodiz Memoria is a service that allows users to create
                personalized video tributes for funeral services. It makes it
                easy to collect media such as photos, videos, and music through
                a user-friendly platform that can be accessed from both
                computers and mobile devices. The service automatically
                synchronizes the media with accompanying music, simplifying the
                process of crafting a meaningful and unique presentation for a
                funeral ceremony. <br> <br>
                
                Afterward, I received my first real
                assignment, which was to help with the development of a new
                website for Aandachttrekkers using WordPress and Slider
                Revolution. However, I quickly realized that this style of work
                wasn’t my preference. I communicated this to the owner, but of
                course, I continued with WordPress because I never give up. He
                also informed me that there would be tasks I might not find
                interesting, but they still had to be completed. I told him I
                preferred working with plain code rather than CMS. A few weeks
                later, I received a new assignment: the orifice calculator. <br> <br>
                
                The
                orifice calculator assists in selecting the optimal orifice size
                and material to ensure precise and efficient cutting. It helps
                maximize tool lifespan and minimize downtime. These orifices are
                widely used in industries such as aerospace, medical device
                manufacturing, and custom fabrication. Additionally, DD
                Technologies offers diamond orifices that are globally
                recognized by leading OEMs for their durability and superior
                performance. The calculator was a huge success at the trade
                show, as the company mentioned. It was such a success that the
                owner requested an expansion because there was significant
                demand to adjust the currency. I was excited to hear that the
                owner was impressed with my work on the calculator, and I
                received praise from my business owner.
